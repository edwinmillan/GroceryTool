# GroceryTool

This is a tool written because we have two checklists on Trello for groceries. "Absolute Necessities" and "Others" which handles incidental grocery items.

Occasionally that "Others" list would get quite full with checked items, and cleaning them out is annoying. So this was written to account for it.
